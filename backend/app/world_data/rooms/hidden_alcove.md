# Hidden Alcove

## Location: hidden_alcove

## Connections: south=cave_entrance

## Items: climbing_gear, magical_rope, healing_potion, explorer_journal, grappling_hook

## Lighting: dark

## Type: dead_end, secret_cache

This small hidden chamber was clearly used by a previous explorer as a supply cache. The alcove is barely large enough to stand upright, but it's dry and shows signs of careful organization. Professional climbing gear hangs from iron hooks on the walls, alongside other valuable equipment. A narrow crack in the cave wall leads back south to the main entrance.

Professional climbing gear hangs from iron hooks driven into the walls: a coiled rope that gleams with subtle magical enhancement, pitons, a climbing hammer, and leather harnesses. A sturdy grappling hook with a sharp four-pronged head rests nearby, its rope coiled and ready for use. A healing potion glows softly in a protective crystal vial, while an explorer's journal wrapped in oiled leather rests on a small stone shelf.

The journal's final entry speaks of the "blue light beyond the chasm" and warnings about "the crystal's guardian curse." Previous explorers clearly discovered this place and used it to prepare for the challenges ahead.

A small cairn of stones in the corner suggests this may also serve as a memorial to those who didn't return. The cache represents the accumulated wisdom and preparation of adventurers who came before.
