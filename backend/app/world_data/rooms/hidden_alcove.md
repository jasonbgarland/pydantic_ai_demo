# Hidden Alcove

## Location: hidden_alcove
## Connections: south=cave_entrance
## Items: climbing_gear, magical_rope, healing_potion, explorer_journal
## Lighting: dark
## Type: dead_end, secret_cache

You squeeze through the narrow crack in the cave wall and emerge into a small hidden chamber that some previous explorer used as a supply cache. The alcove is barely large enough to stand upright, but it's dry and shows signs of careful organization.

Professional climbing gear hangs from iron hooks driven into the walls: a coiled rope that gleams with subtle magical enhancement, pitons, a climbing hammer, and leather harnesses. A healing potion glows softly in a protective crystal vial, while an explorer's journal wrapped in oiled leather rests on a small stone shelf.

The journal's final entry speaks of the "blue light beyond the chasm" and warnings about "the crystal's guardian curse." Previous explorers clearly discovered this place and used it to prepare for the challenges ahead.

A small cairn of stones in the corner suggests this may also serve as a memorial to those who didn't return. The cache represents the accumulated wisdom and preparation of adventurers who came before.
