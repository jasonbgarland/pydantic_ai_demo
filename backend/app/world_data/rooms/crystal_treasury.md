You emerge into a breathtaking natural cathedral carved from living rock. The chamber soars thirty feet overhead, its ceiling lost in dancing shadows cast by an extraordinary sight: a massive crystal suspended in the center of the room, pulsing with inner blue light.

The Crystal of Echoing Depths hovers three feet above an ornate stone pedestal, slowly rotating and casting prismatic patterns across the walls. Its light reveals intricate murals depicting ancient ceremonies and forgotten civilizations. The crystal hums with barely audible energy, and you feel its power resonating in your bones.

The pedestal sits atop a circular pressure plate made of polished obsidian, inscribed with symbols that match those in the murals. Around the room's perimeter, smaller alcoves contain scattered gold coins and artifacts, but the crystal is clearly the chamber's prize.

The air shimmers with residual magic, and you sense that disturbing the crystal will have consequences. The murals seem to warn of guardians and traps, though the chamber appears empty now.
