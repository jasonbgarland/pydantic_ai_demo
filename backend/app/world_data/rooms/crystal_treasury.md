## Items: crystal_of_echoing_depths, ancient_murals, pressure_plate, gold_coins

## Lighting: magical_blue_glow

## Treasure: main objective location

You emerge into a breathtaking natural cathedral carved from living rock. The chamber soars thirty feet overhead, its ceiling lost in dancing shadows cast by an extraordinary sight: a massive crystal suspended in the center of the room, pulsing with inner blue light.

The Crystal of Echoing Depths hovers three feet above an ornate stone pedestal, slowly rotating and casting prismatic patterns across the walls. Its light reveals intricate murals depicting ancient ceremonies and forgotten civilizations. The crystal hums with barely audible energy, and you feel its power resonating in your bones.

The pedestal sits atop a circular pressure plate made of polished obsidian, inscribed with symbols that match those in the murals. Around the room's perimeter, smaller alcoves contain scattered gold coins and artifacts, but the crystal is clearly the chamber's prize.

The air shimmers with residual magic, and you sense that disturbing the crystal will have consequences. The murals seem to warn of guardians and traps, though the chamber appears empty now.

## Atmospheric Details

- The crystal's light pulses like a slow heartbeat, creating shifting shadows
- Murals depict robed figures performing rituals around similar crystals
- The hum of magical energy creates a sense of reverence and danger
- Gold coins scattered about suggest previous treasure seekers
- The pressure plate bears ancient warning symbols

## Treasure Mechanics

- Taking the crystal triggers the cave-in trap (Act 3 setup)
- Murals provide clues about the crystal's power and dangers
- Pressure plate activates when the crystal is removed from its position
- Gold coins are freely available but the crystal is the main prize

## Discovery Opportunities

- Studying murals reveals the crystal's history and warning about consequences
- Examining the pressure plate shows it's connected to the chamber's structure
- The crystal itself radiates detectable magical energy
- Hidden alcoves might contain additional treasures or magical items
- Testing the pedestal's mechanisms before taking the crystal

## THE BIG WARNING ⚠️

**EXAMINE THE MURALS BEFORE TAKING THE CRYSTAL!** Critical warnings ahead.

The ancient murals tell a clear story with important warnings:

1. The crystal is powerful and valuable
2. It was placed here as part of a protective system
3. Removing it from the pedestal triggers a **catastrophic cave-in**
4. The cave will collapse room by room
5. You will have only **minutes** to escape

**This is not a secret!** The game wants you to know this so you can prepare.

## The Murals' Message

The ancient pictographs show:

- Robed figures placing the crystal on the pedestal with great ceremony
- Symbols indicating the pedestal is a "trigger" or "key"
- Images of caves collapsing, rocks falling, passages sealing
- A figure fleeing with the crystal toward light (escape)
- A glowing crystal illuminating dark passages during collapse

**Translation**: "This crystal guards this place. Taking it will destroy the protection. The bearer must flee swiftly, using the crystal's light to navigate the chaos. Only the swift and prepared will escape with their prize."
