# Cave Entrance

## Location: cave_entrance

## Connections: east=yawning_chasm, north=hidden_alcove

## Items: rope, torch, leather_pack

## Lighting: dim

You stand at the mouth of an ancient cave, where daylight fades into mysterious shadows. Moisture drips steadily from stalactites overhead, creating small puddles on the uneven stone floor. The air carries a faint echo of distant water and the musty scent of ages-old stone.

A weathered rope lies coiled near the entrance, left behind by some previous explorer. A flickering torch mounted on the wall casts dancing shadows across crude carvings that hint at the cave's ancient origins. A leather pack rests against the wall, its contents unknown but promising.

To the east, the cave tunnel descends deeper into darkness, where you can hear the faint sound of wind rushing across empty space. To the north, a narrow crack in the wall seems wide enough to squeeze through, though it's unclear where it leads.

The entrance provides your last glimpse of the outside world before venturing into the depths. Safety lies behind you, but adventure awaits ahead.

## Atmospheric Details

- Water drips creating small echoing sounds
- Torch flames flicker in subtle air currents
- Ancient carved symbols on the cave walls suggest this place was once significant
- Fresh air from outside mixes with the deep cave's musty atmosphere
- The transition from daylight to shadow creates an ominous mood

### Ancient Carved Symbols

The cave walls near the entrance bear intricate carvings, weathered by centuries but still partially legible. The symbols appear to be a mixture of pictographs and abstract geometric patterns:

- **Central spiral motif**: A large spiral carved deep into the stone, possibly representing a journey inward or the passage of time
- **Repeated wave patterns**: Undulating lines that might symbolize water or the underworld
- **Stick figure processions**: Small carved figures appear to be carrying offerings or treasures into the depths
- **Warning glyphs**: Several angular symbols that create an ominous feeling, perhaps cautioning explorers

The carvings suggest this cave system held ritual significance to an ancient culture. Some symbols resemble those found in other sacred caves throughout the region, hinting at a broader network of underground sites. The precision of the carvings indicates they were made with metal tools, unusual for primitive cultures.

Close examination reveals that portions of the symbols have been deliberately defaced or worn smooth, as if someone tried to erase certain messages. What secrets did they wish to hide?

## Discovery Opportunities

- Examining the carvings might reveal clues about the cave's history
- The rope appears well-made and could be useful for climbing
- The leather pack may contain useful supplies
- The torch could be taken for better lighting deeper in the cave
