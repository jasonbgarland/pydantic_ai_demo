# Cave Entrance

## Location: cave_entrance

## Connections: east=yawning_chasm, north=hidden_alcove

## Items: rope, torch, leather_pack

## Lighting: dim

You stand at the mouth of an ancient cave, where daylight fades into mysterious shadows. Moisture drips steadily from stalactites overhead, creating small puddles on the uneven stone floor. The air carries a faint echo of distant water and the musty scent of ages-old stone.

A weathered rope lies coiled near the entrance, left behind by some previous explorer. A flickering torch mounted on the wall casts dancing shadows across crude carvings that hint at the cave's ancient origins. A leather pack rests against the wall, its contents unknown but promising.

To the east, the cave tunnel descends deeper into darkness, where you can hear the faint sound of wind rushing across empty space. To the north, a narrow crack in the wall seems wide enough to squeeze through, though it's unclear where it leads.

The entrance provides your last glimpse of the outside world before venturing into the depths. Safety lies behind you, but adventure awaits ahead.
