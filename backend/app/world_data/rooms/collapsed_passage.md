## Lighting: very_dark
## Type: dead_end, earthquake_aftermath

You enter what was once a passage but is now a tomb of fallen stone. A recent earthquake has brought down massive chunks of the ceiling, creating an impassable barrier of rubble and debris. The air is thick with stone dust, and smaller rocks still occasionally tumble from the unstable ceiling above.

Among the devastation, you can make out the crushed remains of supply packs and equipment - evidence that other explorers were caught in the collapse. A twisted metal beam protrudes from the debris pile, perhaps part of mining equipment or structural support that failed when the earth shook.

A weathered warning sign, somehow still standing despite the destruction, bears the faded words: "DANGER - UNSTABLE GROUND - PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK." The irony is not lost on you as you survey the aftermath of what the sign predicted.

The collapse appears recent enough that the dust hasn't fully settled. This passage might have once provided an alternative route to the crystal treasury, but now serves only as a grim reminder of the cave system's inherent dangers.

## Atmospheric Details
- Stone dust creates a hazy, choking atmosphere
- Occasional falling debris creates tension and urgency
- Crushed equipment tells the story of trapped explorers
- Warning sign adds dark humor to the dangerous situation
- Unstable ceiling suggests more collapses could follow

## Scavenging Opportunities
- Metal beam could be useful as a prying tool or makeshift bridge
- Rubble pile might contain salvageable equipment pieces  
- Warning sign provides clues about the cave's geological instability
- Examining the collapse pattern reveals information about earthquake timing

## Foreshadowing Elements
- Recent collapse hints at ongoing geological instability
- Sets up the cave-in trap that occurs when crystal is taken
- Demonstrates the real danger of being trapped underground
- Warning sign's message becomes prophetic for the adventure's climax
