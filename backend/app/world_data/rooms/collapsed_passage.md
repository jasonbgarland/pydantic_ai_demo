# Collapsed Passage

## Location: collapsed_passage

## Connections: north=yawning_chasm

## Items: rubble_pile, metal_beam, crushed_supplies, warning_sign

## Lighting: very_dark

## Type: dead_end, earthquake_aftermath

You enter what was once a passage but is now a tomb of fallen stone. A recent earthquake has brought down massive chunks of the ceiling, creating an impassable barrier of rubble and debris. The air is thick with stone dust, and smaller rocks still occasionally tumble from the unstable ceiling above.

Among the devastation, you can make out the crushed remains of supply packs and equipment - evidence that other explorers were caught in the collapse. A twisted metal beam protrudes from the debris pile, perhaps part of mining equipment or structural support that failed when the earth shook.

A weathered warning sign, somehow still standing despite the destruction, bears the faded words: "DANGER - UNSTABLE GROUND - PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK." The irony is not lost on you as you survey the aftermath of what the sign predicted.

The collapse appears recent enough that the dust hasn't fully settled. This passage might have once provided an alternative route to the crystal treasury, but now serves only as a grim reminder of the cave system's inherent dangers.

## Atmospheric Details

- Stone dust creates a hazy, choking atmosphere
- Occasional falling debris creates tension and urgency
- Crushed equipment tells the story of trapped explorers
- Warning sign adds dark humor to the dangerous situation
- Unstable ceiling suggests more collapses could follow

## Scavenging Opportunities

- Metal beam could be useful as a prying tool or makeshift bridge
- Rubble pile might contain salvageable equipment pieces
- Warning sign provides clues about the cave's geological instability
- Examining the collapse pattern reveals information about earthquake timing

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING - THIS IS A DEAD END! ⚠️

**This passage is COMPLETELY BLOCKED!** There is no way through!

The rubble pile is massive - tons of rock and debris. It would take:

- **Days** of excavation work with proper equipment
- **Multiple people** with shovels and hauling tools
- **Structural expertise** to avoid causing another collapse

**You cannot dig through this!** Even if you could, you don't have time.

## Why This Matters

If you're here **AFTER taking the crystal** from the treasury:

🚨 **YOU WENT THE WRONG WAY!** 🚨

The escape route is **NORTH to the Chasm, then WEST to the Entrance!**

**DO NOT COME HERE DURING THE ESCAPE!**

The explorer's journal specifically warned:
_"Do NOT go south to the collapsed passage - it's a dead end. GO WEST IMMEDIATELY."_

## If You're Here During the Collapse

The game will make this very clear:

**Narrator**: _"The rumbling intensifies! This dead end is a death trap! You must go NORTH immediately, back to the chasm and then west to the entrance!"_

You still have time to:

1. `go north` - Return to the Yawning Chasm
2. `use rope` or `use grappling hook` - Cross the chasm quickly
3. `go west` - Get back to the Cave Entrance
4. `go west` again - EXIT TO SAFETY!

**Don't panic - just turn around and follow the escape route!**

## If You're Here BEFORE Taking the Crystal

**Good news**: You're exploring safely and can leave whenever you want.

**What you learn here**:

1. This passage is completely blocked (no alternate route)
2. The cave system is geologically unstable (foreshadowing)
3. This confirms there's only ONE way to the treasury (through the chasm)
4. This is NOT a viable escape route (remember this!)

**Recommendation**: `go north` to return to the Yawning Chasm

## Foreshadowing Elements

- Recent collapse hints at ongoing geological instability
- Sets up the cave-in trap that occurs when crystal is taken
- Demonstrates the real danger of being trapped underground
- Warning sign's message becomes prophetic for the adventure's climax

## Strategic Value

Visiting this room teaches you:

- **The exit route matters** - Not all paths lead out
- **The cave is unstable** - Taking the crystal will be dangerous
- **No alternate routes** - The way you came is the way you leave
- **Respect the warnings** - The journal and murals are right

**Meta lesson**: When the game warns you during the escape, LISTEN! Going south during the collapse is an instant failure scenario.

## Class-Agnostic Advice

**All classes should**:

- Note this is a dead end and leave
- Remember this is NOT the escape route
- Use this knowledge to plan the crystal heist escape
- When collapse starts, go NORTH/WEST only!

This room exists to:

1. Teach you the cave layout
2. Build tension (geological instability)
3. Provide a failure state (wrong direction during escape)
4. Reward exploration (knowledge of what NOT to do)

**Now that you've seen there's nothing here, go back north and continue your adventure!**
